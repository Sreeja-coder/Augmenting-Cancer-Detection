 # Augmenting-Cancer-Detection
 
 ####  Problem Statement :
  In this project we are trying to explore and analyze two different datasets, one collected by doing biopsy and another using X-ray images to see if we can get almost     the same accuracy in detecting cancer using data with and without biopsy.

 ####  Introduction :
  Every cell in the human body has a DNA, which is responsible for building and maintaining the organism. DNA does this by sending out the code for producing certain      kinds of proteins necessary for cell growth and division. DNA cannot directly send out this information to the nucleus; it uses RNA (m-RNA, t-RNA, r-RNA) for this   communication. So, at times the DNA mutates and sends signals to divide and grow cell uncontrolled. This causes the cell to mutate and grow, invading other tissues.
Thus, this disease of controlled cell division is called Cancer.
